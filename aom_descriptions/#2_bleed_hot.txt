#2 BLEED HOT
- overhead condition (over 290 degrees) in related bleed air supply duct downstream of pressure regulator and shut-off
valve. Affected PSRV and high pressure bleed valve closes to cut off hot air supply to duct (bleed supply to deicing
system via low pressure port is unaffected). When temperature drops below the overtemperature level, bleed air
operation in affected nacelle is restored and light extinguishes.
