FLIGHT DATA RECORDER
The digital flight data recorder system assesses,
measures and records parameters of flight for subse-
quent analysis or investigation of incidents or acci-
dents. The system consists of a crash protected flight
data tape recorder mounted in the tail cone, an ac-
quisition/measurement unit mounted on the avionics
rack, a three axis accelerometer located on the rear
spar, and a control panel located on the overhead
console in the flight compartment. The system is en-
ergized when the anti ---collision lights are on and the
aircraft electrical system is powered. The system is
also energized without the anti ---collision lights being
turned on when the aircraft leaves the ground. A FLT
DATA RECORDER caution light on the caution lights
panel illuminates whenever the flight data recorder is
inoperative.
Data is recorded on a mylar based magnetic record-
ing tape to provide a crash ---survivable record of criti-
cal flight parameters for the previous 25 hours. Play-
back of recorded information is only possible by
maintenance personnel. The flight data tape record-
er is equipped with an underwater locater beacon
that automatically emits a sonar ’ping’ when the unit
is immersed in water.
For system test select the FLIGHT DATA RECORDER
switch on the overhead console to the momentary
GND TEST. The FLT DATA RECORDER caution light
will go out to indicate serviceability.
