FLIGHT DATA RECORDER
the flight data recorder is inoperative. Data is recorded on a mylar based magnetic record-
ing tape to provide a crash ---survivable record of criti-
cal flight parameters for the previous 25 hours. Play-
back of recorded information is only possible by
maintenance personnel. For system test select the FLIGHT DATA RECORDER
switch on the overhead console to the momentary
GND TEST. The FLT DATA RECORDER caution light
will go out to indicate serviceability.
